The [quattor project area within SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quattor/) has been updated to the new _Allura_ version of Forge. What does this mean?

* there's some slight layout differences
* a new source browser
* a new ticket system
* the GIT repositories have different URLs.

Previous, the repository URL would look like:

* `git://quattor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/quattor/$REPONAME`

Now, the repository URL looks like

* `ssh://$USERNAME@git.code.sf.net/p/quattor/$REPONAME`

The old repository URLs are still available, but readonly.
