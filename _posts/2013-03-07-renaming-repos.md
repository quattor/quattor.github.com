title: Renaming repositories in GitHub
category: news

The names of many of our repositories in GitHub were difficult to
understand for newcomers into Quattor.

We have renamed a few of them:

* `ncm-components-core` becomes `configuration-modules-core`
* `ncm-components-grid` becomes `configuration-modules-grid`

Old QWG templates will have also more meaningful names.
