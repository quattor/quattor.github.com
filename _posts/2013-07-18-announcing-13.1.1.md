category: news
---

We are happy to announce Quattor 13.6.  This is the stable release,
with the old SPMA and just bugs fixed or new components.  If you
cannot use the feature releases, you are advised to upgrade!

The goal of this series is to provide an upgrade path that doesn't
disrupt any existing infrastructures.  Existing components won't
receive any cool features in this series.

The RPMs will reach the [Yum repositories](http://yum.quattor.org)
shortly.

As usual, thanks to our contributors and users for their help and
feedback.

## Changes

### Configuration modules

* We have included `ncm-ganglia`, contributed by our
[Stratuslab](http://stratuslab.eu) friends.
* `ncm-network` supports more naming schemes for network devices.

The Grid-specific modules have seen bugs fixed on `ncm-myproxy` and
`ncm-globuscfg`.

Bugs have been fixed in `ncm-ipmi` and

### ncm-ncd

We have fixed a long-standing bug in the handling of the `--nodeps`
flag.

## Next release

Next release will be 13.1.2, and will happen by the end of September.
