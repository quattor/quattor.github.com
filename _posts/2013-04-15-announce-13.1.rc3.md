title: Quattor 13.1 RC 3 is out
category: news

We have just tagged and uploaded to the
[Yum repositories](http://yum.quattor.org) the third release candidate
for Quattor 13.1.  This is a bugfix release, with many fixes
from 13.3, but with the old SPMA.

We encourage users who cannot upgrade yet to the new SPMA to use
Quattor 13.1 instead.  In the mean time, testing and feedback on this
release candidate will be greatly appreciated.
