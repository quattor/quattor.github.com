category: news
---

One week late, we are happy to announce Quattor 13.6.  This is the
feature release, with the Yum-based SPMA and the cool stuff.  You are
advised to upgrade!  The RPMs will reach the
[Yum repositories](http://yum.quattor.org) shortly.

As usual, thanks to our contributors and users for their help and
feedback.

## Major changes

### AII

* [Better reporting of errors](https://github.com/quattor/aii/pull/22)
* Removed obsoleted packages from the basic list

### Configuration modules

For the general-purpose modules:

* The chkconfig module has been
  [rewritten almost entirely]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/83),
  and is now much easier to understand and to maintain.  Some bugs
  were fixed in the process.
* ncm-postfix supports now
  [multiple LDAP databases](https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/91).
  This required a change to the schema that might break backwards
  compatibility: two fields are now lists of structures instead of
  just simple structures.
* The SPMA module supports now
  [multiple proxies and URLs]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/79)
* The SPMA module has now even [better error handling]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/78)
* We can now set the
  [owner of the NRPE config file]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/84)
* The network module supports now more [naming conventions for network cards]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/77).
* [Clean ups to ncm-ofed]((https://github.com/quattor/configuration-modules-core/pull/85)

The Grid-specific ones have seen bugs fixed on `ncm-myproxy` and
`ncm-globuscfg`.

### ncm-ncd

We have fixed a long-standing bug in the handling of the `--nodeps`
flag.

## Next release

Next release will be 13.9, and will happen in September.
