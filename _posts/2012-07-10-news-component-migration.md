You have probably noticed that some components are no longer in
Subversion. Where did they go?

Easy. We are migrating gradually to a new infrastructure, with Git for
version control and Maven as the build system. Only obsoleted
components will stay in SVN.

All core components are already in the
[the Sourceforge Git repository](git://quattor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/quattor/core-ncm-components). We'll do the same for the Grid-based ones.
