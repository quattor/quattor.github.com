An introduction to installing Aquilon
-------------------------------------

This guide describes the installation of an Aquilon broker on a Scientific Linux 6 host (It should work for  any RedHat 6 clone).

With your basic OS installed you should add the prerequisites described in [Aquilon Prerequisites](http://quattor.org/documentation/2012/10/31/aquilon-prerequisites.html).

You will need kerberos authentication working, either with your own server or one provided by your institution.

You will need a kerberos keytab for your server.

Now install Aquilon itself
