title: Quattor 13.1 is out
category: news

We have just tagged and uploaded to the
[Yum repositories](http://yum.quattor.org) Quattor 13.1.  This is a
bugfix release, with many fixes from 13.3, but with the old SPMA.

We encourage users who cannot upgrade yet to the new SPMA to use
Quattor 13.1 instead.  In the mean time, testing and feedback on this
release candidate will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks to all our contributors, and to the sites who tested and
validated the release candidates.

In the following weeks we'll make a decision on the follow-up for
these "stable" releases. Stay tuned!
