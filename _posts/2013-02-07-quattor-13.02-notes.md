title: Release notes for Quattor 13.02
category: documentation

These are the main features and caveats of Quattor 13.02:

## Supported platforms

It has been tested and is known to work on Scientific Linux 6.2 and
newer, and 5.6 and newer.

It you are using any older version of Scientific Linux or any other
Red Hat derivative, you *must not* upgrade:

* aii-ks
* ncm-spma

And you *must* retain:

* spma
* rpmt-py

## Software package management

The old `spma` package has been removed from the release.  So has been
`rpmt-py`.  Quattor 13.02 ships with the Yum-based SPMA.

Using Yum changes the way we'll handle our packages.  Please read the
[package management recommendations]() before deciding whether to
upgrade.  If you decide the new package manager is for you, follow the
[upgrade guide]().

## Installation infrastructure

The Kickstart generator in Quattor 13.02 will *only* install systems
that use the new SPMA.  If you choose not to upgrade yet, don't
upgrade to the new `aii-ks` either.

## Downloading

Packages are available at our
[Yum repository](http://yum.quattor.org).

## Other changes

* `ncm-query` is now part of the release.
* The Grid-related components have been released.  These don't have
  (yet) the same QA process as the core components, but it's useful
  for many users to have these components in a repository.
