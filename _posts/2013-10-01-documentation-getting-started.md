title: Getting Started with Quattor
category: documentation

Quattor is a complete, but somewhat complex, set of tools for
automated machine management.  This document provides a gentle
introduction that highlights the main capabilities of Quattor by
showing you how to install a server and take partial control of
another machine.  Production use will require a good knowledge of the
toolset and your site configuration.

Install Aquilon
---------------

To install Aquilon, follow this [documentation](http://www.quattor.org/documentation/2012/10/31/install-aquilon.html)

Basic Site Configuration
------------------------

Taking Control of Client Machine
--------------------------------

Add User Account
----------------

Next Steps
----------

Now you have seen how the Quattor server and client software are
installed and used.  Running Quattor in production will require more
detailed knowledge about the Quattor Toolkit and Quattor best
practices.

In particular, you will need to investigate further the following
topics:

* Using Quattor to install a machine from scratch.
* Configuring the security for the Quattor system.

You can find additional documentation concerning these topics and
others in the [documentation][qdocs] part of the Quattor web site.
