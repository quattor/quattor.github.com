### Standups

Standup meetings are held each Thursday as needed, see [the contacts page](/contacts) for more information.

These are short (15-30 minute) discussions on current development activities.

### Workshops

The Quattor Working Group normally has a face-to-face meeting twice a year, agendas can be found in the [Quattor Indico category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/2921/). Each meeting also reviews all open GitHub issues with the label [discuss at workshop](http://quattor.org/release/to_discuss).

These meetings are both a meeting of people who contribute to Quattor's development (which can be anyone &mdash; just open a <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>!) as well as an opportunity for users to meet with experts, discuss their local problems and to learn about (and influence) Quattor's future evolution.

Summaries of these workshops are listed below.
