### DESCRIPTION

This component configures amanda server, the  "Advanced  Maryland  Automatic
Network  Disk  Archiver"

### FILES

This component generates the following files:
`/etc/amanda/backupname/amanda.conf`
/etc/amanda/backupname/disklist

Furthermore, when using virtual tapes (tpchanger='chg-disk') it creates
(only if these files do not exist previously)
`/etc/amanda/backupname/tapelist`
tapedev\_dir/slotXX
and symbolic to the first slot.

It also label the virtual tapes
(this is very dangerous cause labelling the tapes destroy the content,
have this into account if you already have data in the tapedev directory)
