### DESCRIPTION

The _filesystems_ component manages the filesystems on a node. It is able
to create and remove blockdevices without restarting or
re-installing.

These filesystems will be later mounted/unmounted, and added/removed
from fstab, using ncm-fstab.

The component doesn't provide any special resources at the moment. It
just watches for changes on `/system/filesystems` and `/system/blockdevices` and
creates new filesystems, if needed.

A blockdevice is useful only for its ability to hold a
filesystem. Blockdevices with no filesystems associated will not be
created. If you want any such device, create a filesystem with
"type"="none" and "mount"=false.

#### To do list

It will also remove filesystems and blockdevices that are not listed
on the profile (or have been removed). For this to be safe, it must be
possible to specify a list of filesystems that can't be touched.

Spare drives have not been tested yet.

Resizing operations, are not yet implemented.

#### Examples

We will define a software RAID 1 composed of three disks, one volume
group named Springfield on it, and two logical volumes (Simpsons and
Flanders) on it. They will be mounted on `/Evergreen`\_Terrace/742 and
`/Evergreen`\_Terrace/740, respectively.

This is how the block devices definition looks like:

    "/system/blockdevices" = nlist (
	"physical_devs", nlist (
		"hda", nlist ("label", "none"),
		"hdb", nlist ("label", "none"),
		"hdc", nlist ("label", "none")
		),
	### No partitions here
	"md", nlist (
		"md0", nlist (
			"device_list", list (
				"physical_devs/hda",
				"physical_devs/hdb",
				"physical_devs/hdc"
				),
			"raid_level", "RAID1",
			"stripe_size", 64
			),
		),
	"volume_groups", nlist (
		"Springfield", nlist (
			"device_list", list ("md/md0")
			),
		),
	"logical_volumes", nlist (
		"Simpsons", nlist (
			"size", 5*GB,
			"volume_group", "Springfield"
			),
		"Flanders", nlist (
			"size", 4*GB,
			"volume_group", "Springfield"
			)
		)
	);

And then, we can define the filesystems:

    "/system/filesystems" = list (
	nlist (
		"mountpoint", "/EverGreenTerrace/740",
		"block_device", "logical_volumes/Flanders",
		"mount", true,
		"mountopts", "defaults",
		"type", "ext2", ### God saves from crashes, you know
		"freq", 0,
		"pass", 0,
		"format", false,
		"preserve", true
		),
	nlist (
		"mountpoint", "/EverGreenTerrace/742",
		"block_device", "logical_volumes/Simpsons",
		"mount", true,
		"mountopts", "defaults",
		"type", "xfs", ### Lisa's on charge!
		"freq", 0,
		"pass", 0,
		"format", false,
		"preserve", true
		),
	);
