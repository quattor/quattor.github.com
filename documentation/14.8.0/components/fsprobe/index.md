### DESCRIPTION

Updates the `/etc/sysconfig/fsprobe` configuration.  This is used by
the CERN-CC-fsprobe package to start fsprobe on the relevant file systems.

The CDB entries are added to the file.  No user editing of the file should
be performed as this will be overwritten on the next execution.

Returns error in case of a failure.

The fields are

    logfile	File to log to : default `/var/log/fsprobe.log`
    mailto	users to mail to when corruption detected
    options	additional arguments for fsprobe
    syslog	log to syslog
    filesystems	file systems to monitor (regular expressions)
    dir		directory within the file system to test to
    mailsubject subject of mail
    remotefs	allow probing of remote file systems.  Default is local only.

For example,

    "/software/components/fsprobe/active" = true;
    "/software/components/fsprobe/syslog" = true;
    "/software/components/fsprobe/mailto" = "system.admin@cern.ch";
    "/software/components/fsprobe/options" = "--MultiPattern --RndWait --SleepTime 300 --ContinueOnDiff --DumpBuffers "+fsprobedirectio;
