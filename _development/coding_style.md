Introduction
------------

All major software projects have a set of guidelines for their code. It helps
people to understand each other's code,
and even your own code a few months (or days!) after you wrote it for the first time.

There are lots of documents motivating this, feel free to review them.
[This one](http://www.kroah.com/linux/talks/ols_2002_kernel_codingstyle_paper/codingstyle.ps)
is a good starting point but in short:

-   I want to read your code.
-   I want you to read my code.
-   I want to fix your bugs.
-   I want you to fix my bugs.

The basics
----------

### Editor Settings

Configure your editor of choice to:
* Insert spaces instead of Tabs
  * When `Tab` is pressed
  * When performing automatic indentation.
* Remove trailing whitespace from lines.
* Remove extra new lines from the end of the file.
* Insert a new line at the end of the file if there is not one.
* Maximum line length to 120 characters

### Indentation

Use 4 white spaces. No tabs, no 8 white spaces, no funny things. Fix your editor's configuration,
or use a decent one. There are plenty of them.

### Capitalisation

Use lowercase for local variables, uppercase for constants.

We have no consistent convention for function names enforced in the existing code but
the recommendation is `function_names_like_this_one` rather than `functionNameLikeThis`.

### Use meaningful names for global variables, short names for local variables

`i` is a perfectly valid identifier for a loop variable. However, you deserve nasty punishment
if you use it as a function name.

On the opposite, `this_is_a_temporary_counter` is plain bad for a loop variable.

So, some good examples:

```perl
sub write_user_credentials
{
    # ...
}
```

```perl
foreach my $i (0..10) {
    # ...
}
```


And very bad examples:

```perl
sub wuc
{
    # WTH???
}
```

```perl
foreach my $counter_from_0_to_10_included (0..10) {
    # Excuse me???
}
```

### Be modular

Really, it **matters**. Have you ever tried to understand a module which is 700 lines long?
Did you ever try to understand what's the purpose
of a variable that was defined 5 screens ago? Or the meaning of the 30th variable on this block?
Or the purpose of that line that starts and finishes beyond the screen?

Here are the classic metrics for modularity:

* No lines longer than 80 columns.
  * Split or rearrange longer strings
  * Split longer statements
* If you have more than 3 levels of indentation, split your block
* If your function goes beyond the screen, split it
  * And don't try to reduce the font. ;)
* If you have more than 7 local variables, split your function.
  * Sometimes it's OK to have 10, but if you have 15 your code is a problem.

### Don't use magic numbers

Use [`Readonly`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Readonly) to give meaningful names to any values other than `0` and `1` that you need.
They'll help you to understand why you chose such values on the past.

A good example:

```perl
Readonly my $PI => 3.141592;
my $circle_area = $radius ** 2 * $PI;
```

And the bad example:

```perl
# Oops! I missed a decimal somewhere!
my $circle_area = $radius ** 2 * 3.14159;
```

### Module header

A Perl module **must** start with a line like:

```perl
#${PMpre} NCM::Component::mycomp${PMpost}
```

Update `NCM::Component::mycomp` to reflect the namespace of your module.

This ensures that the module starts with the proper information about license, authors...
and this adds the `use strict`, `use warnings` and other things that are required in
every Quattor module. **Never had them manually**.

### Comments

When in doubt, don't use them.

Comment all Pan data structures, or at least provide a link to their full description. Try
to use the new annotation syntax which can be processed to produce the documentation.

Comment the purpose of each file, probably using POD syntax. Write a comment before the
beginning of each function, telling
what it does and how to use it. But don't annoy the reader with the internals.

Don't comment function bodies. If your code is so complex that it needs further explanations,
you should probably split it in several functions and comment those functions. Of course, sometimes
you have to work around some broken API, or some corner case. In such case, please comment
**why** you are doing it, but not **how**. And don't comment the obvious.

Bad examples:

```perl
############################################################
#
# Increment by 1
#
############################################################
$i++;
```

```perl
sub do_something
{
   my @args = @_;

   # I do foo and bar here
   ...
   ...
   ...

   # And now, let's do bar again, but with a small difference
   ...
   ...
}
```

These are best done like this:

```perl
$i++;
```

```perl
# Performs task foo...
sub foo {...}

# Performs task bar...
sub bar {...}

# Performs task baz, which is quite similar to bar
sub baz {...}

# Performs a set of tasks, returning blah blah with arguments
# $arg1:
# $arg2:
sub do_something
{
    my @args = @_;
    foo (@args);
    bar (@args);
    baz (@args);
}
```

### Don't use `vars`

This pragma has been deprecated since Perl 5.6, and that's a long time ago. Instead,
use the `our` declaration for package-wide variables:

Good:

```perl
our @EXPORT = ...;
```

Bad:

```perl
use vars qw (@EXPORT);
@EXPORT = ...;
```

### Curly bracket position

Follow Kernighan-Ritchie's convention: open curly brackets on the same line as the sentence
they belong to and close them on a line for their own, excepting when it's an else or a do-while block:

```perl
if ($foo) {
    ...
}
```

```perl
while ($bar) {
    ...
}
```

```perl
if ($foo) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
```

```perl
do {
    ...
} while ($bar);
```


This way it is perfectly clear where each block starts, finishes and continues.

The only exception to this are the curly brackets that open a function. They should be on a
different line, and have nothing else on the same line:

```perl
sub foo
{
    my @args = @_;
}
```

The reason for this is that decent editors (f.i, Emacs) are aware that such curly braces mean
something special, and allow you to move to the beginning and the end of a function with a
single key stroke. This is a great help for navigating code.

### Parenthesis

Use them a lot. When in doubt, use them. Especially:

-   Always use parenthesis on function calls
-   Always use them on function calls even when there are no arguments

The reason is that:

```perl
foo();
```

Is easier to understand than:

```perl
foo;
```

### Prefer methods over plain functions

Especially when writing components, you want to log unexpected things. It's free to have a
`$self` object, and let it log.

Only use plain functions if you want them exported to some other module.


## The Quattor library (aka CAF)

`CAF` is a set of modules that provide an interface to system calls (or their Perl equivalent)
allowing to execute commands,
manipulate files... It is mandatory to use them rather than the system calls for the following reasons:

- If they generate exceptions, this is properly handled to avoid crashing the configuration module.
- They log what they are doing  on the terminal and in log files with a verbosity controlled by command
options or the daemon configuration.
- For file manipulations, a lot of checks are done to avoid doing weird things like silently following
symlinks and overwriting files.
- They are mocked by the Quattor unit test framework, allowing to run unit tests without root access or
without installing the underlying services.

`CAF` documentation is part of the online [Quattor documentation][quattor_documentation].

### Running commands

Do not use backticks or `system`, nor use `open` for pipes. The `CAF::Process` module has all you need,
and it won't spawn new subshells, which is much safer.

As the `CAF::Process` module logs the command line that you are executing at verbose and debug levels,
you don't need to handle the logging yourself. Do not do:

```perl
$self->debug (5, "Going to run ls -l");
system ("ls", "-l");
```

Instead, do:

```perl
# Or any reporter object.
my $proc = CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-l"], log => $self);
$proc->run();

# One-line version:
CAF::Process->new (["ls", "-l"], log => $self)->run();
```

The log option is any `CAF::Logger` object, for instance the component you are writing (`$self`).

Sometimes you pass confidential data to your commands. For instance, an encrypted password to `usermod`.
In this cases, you don't want your command logged. Just don't pass any log argument to `CAF::Process::new`:

See [Quattor documentation][quattor_documentation] for examples covering
the most common use cases.


### File handling

Writing to files is not as simple as one could think: there are risks that you should be aware of. For
instance, the following code seems harmless but is an example of what shouldn't be done:

```perl
open (FH, ">/tmp/foo");
```

If `/tmp/foo` already exists and is a symbolic link to `/etc/shadow`, you just lost all accounts on your system.

For this reason, `CAF` provides several modules related to file manipulation:

* `CAF::FileWriter`: allow to create a new file
* `CAF::FileEditor`: allow to update an existing file or create a new one if it doesn't exist yet
* `CAF::FileReader`: allow to read an existing file but not to modify it

`CAF::FileWriter` and `CAF::FileEditor` update a file when the CAF object is closed. The update is done only
if the contents was changed. They allow you to specify the file owner, permissions, a backup file name to save
the existing file if it is modified...

See [Quattor documentation][quattor_documentation] for examples covering the
most common use cases.

#### Temporary files

Don't use them. If you don't use `File::Temp`, you'll use predictable filenames, and that's just bad. Then,
most implementations make temporary files
world readable, and you usually don't want that. If you need temporary storage for some text, use an array,
`IO::String`, in-memory files, a `CAF::FileWriter` or anything like that.

So you want to run a command which needs a file name as an argument, right? Easy. Just pipe to that command,
as shown above. And pass `/dev/fd/0` as the file name.

Finally, if really all these options are not good enough, use `File::Temp::tmpfile`, which will provide you an
anonymous file handle. But please, use this only if you are convinced there is no other way to keep your temporary data.


### Other file operations: CAF::Path

`CAF::Path` is a module related to path operations (rather than file contents). Its main features are:

* Test if a path exists, is a file, a symbolic link, a hard link or a directory
* Symbolic link and hard link management
* Management of file permissions and owner

See [Quattor documentation][quattor_documentation] for more details on the
available methods and for examples covering the most common use cases.

## Input handling

Make sure that your code can run in *tainted mode*: this is a requirement for Quattor configuration modules
and most of the other Quattor components.

The basic thing is that no input should be trusted, even when coming from the host profile.
Sanitise everything just after reading it else Perl will complain that your input is tainted.

Also, when you create files that will be sourced by shell scripts, be sure to print all values between single quotes.
This is true for almost every file you have under `/etc/sysconfig`.

## Quality of messages

The main principle is to find the balance between a totally silent execution and an excessive verbosity that doesn't
allow to identify the important things. Use `info` and `ok` methods only for the important messages, use `verbose`
or `debug` for others. `debug` implies `verbose`.

Provide a detailed trace of any task you perform with `verbose` messages. Trace DNS queries, URLs being retrieved,
services you have to enable or disable... but avoid to log (detailed) output of the actions. You don't need to log
the files that you open or the commands that you run.
The CAF objects will do so for you.

### Debugging output

`debug` is for information only relevant to developers. A normal user should never be required to ask for debug
message to get the information
he needs. This should be used only for developer-relevant stuff, such as tracking temporary contents or so.

There are 5 levels of debug information. We don't have a precise convention about what must be logged at which
level. Generally it is enough to use the first 2 levels.

### Use `error` only for fatal errors

Use the `error` method only if this error will make the entire configuration module to fail.
If you can handle it, or the failure is not really important for
the component's results, use `warn` instead. If failing to download a file is OK because you can work around it,
or you know you may have
no rights to write on AFS, but that's OK, use a `warn` message. `warn` events don't cause the component to fail.

After an error has been logged, the configuration module will be re-run each time a new profile arrives until
it succeeds. And the other configuration modules that depend on it will not be run.

Conclusions
-----------

Code quality matters. It will reduce bugs, and will make everybody's life easier.

All these conventions can be improved, so feedback will be appreciated. Especially, the CAF library can be extended
with whatever task we repeat over and over.
